It would make sense to first create a database in which we would store various information, that way we can then
run code that can add to and take from that database.


## Airport Project Epic:  
Airport Assistant interface for managing flight bookings and flight manifests.  

## User Stories:  
- Create a passengers list with name and passport number to add to flight  
- Create flight trip with specific destination  
- Assign and change a plane to a flight trip using a password  
- Sell tickets to passengers and add them to flight trip  
- Generate a flight list with name and passport number to check identity on flight  

## Instructions:
Use Main File to run the program from main.py  
This will call the menu interface
